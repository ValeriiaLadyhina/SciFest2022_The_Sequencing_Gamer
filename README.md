# Pysequencer - game created by ... for SciFest 2022 in Uppsala, Sweden



# Global idea:


In this game you will recreate Illumina sequencing by building a complementary strand 
                                of DNA( A-T, G-C). In the game you can jump (space bar) to avoid some nucleotides and\n
                                speed up (right arrow) or slow down (left arrow). You will see four type of 
                                nucleotides mentioned earlier (A, C, G, T) and additional N - which will represent an\n
                                unkown nucleotide, that can normally happen with very small chance during sequencing. 
                                In the end of the game the programme will answer to you what sequence you tried to\n
                                build and how good work you did as *Illumina Sequenator*: for every collected 
                                nucleotide you will get 1 point and for N-nucleotide - 0.5.\n
